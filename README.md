7-Segment display with STM32F3Discovery ARM microcontroller
In this implementation we try to display numbers on 7-Segment with stm32 microcontroller using Arm Keil MDK in two following ways:
1. Displaying number 2247 on 7-segment without using an IC. (image is included)
2. Using the IC7447 BCD to 7-Segment display.
